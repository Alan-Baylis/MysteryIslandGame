### To clean Your directory from unwanted files such as untracked or ignored by .gitignore You can run 
> `git clean -fxd`

##### Explanation
`git clean` accepts parameters such as:
* `-f` - If the Git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not set to false, git clean will refuse to delete files or directories unless given -f, -n or -i. Git will refuse to delete directories with .git sub directory or file unless a second -f is given.
* `-x` - git will not use the standard ignore rules read from .gitignore
* `-d` - remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files
* `-n` - dry run. donâ€™t actually remove anything, just show what would be done.

> ##### The `.gitignore` file in our project is configured so our repository takes as little space as possible to allow faster syncs. When You clone the repo and open with Unity Editor. Unity will have to build Your project cache and solutions stored within `library, obj, .csproj`. You can remove the files anytime with `git clean -fxd` but Unity will have to rebuild them when neccessary. The .gitignore allows us to commit changes without uploading directories and files which are not neccessary to build the project.

# Git flow

When You want to add a new feature on an existing repository using gitflow, first pull all branches:
> **git pull origin --all**

Switch to develop
> **git checkout develop**

Create a feature
> **git flow feature start <feature-name>**

Create a feature
> **git flow feature start <feature-name>**

When you create a new feature, git-flow should automatically switch You to the feature/<feature-name> branch and You can check that with `git branch`. If not then:
> **git checkout feature/<feature-name>**

You can now stage changes with `git add -A` and commit them using `git commit` and the VIM editor or `git commit -m "title"`
> **git add -A**
> **git commit / git commit -m "title"**

When You're done with changes You can publish Your feature:
> **git flow feature publish <feature-name>**

To pull a feature use:
> **git flow feature pull origin <feature-name>**
